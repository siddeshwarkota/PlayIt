We are a disruptive online portal and mobile app that integrates sports with technology to deliver a holistic sporting experience using location intelligence. Simply put, you can now book a match at your favourite turf, link up with fellow players, and be a part of sporting events based on where they are, all at the tap of a button. The portal has mapped out a universe of gyms, yoga centres, Zumba studios, adrenaline pumping adventure sports and professional coaching services. We offer a wide selection of sporting apparel, gear and accessories for aspiring athletes.
